# SAS_Automations
Automation of SAS Datasets creation using 100's of weekly files having different layouts using single code  

This code will be usefull if you want to read 100's of files each week and create SAS Datasets using the flat files on weekly basis. 
The generated SAS Datasets and processed flatfiles for each week will get auto archived to the respective archive folder with the timestamp details. 
we need code in such a way that any new addition of file to generate the dataset should have minial code changes.
